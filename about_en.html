      <h2>FIRST <span>(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)</span></h2>
      <p>Mission and Vision：Our mission is to inspire young people to become science and technology leaders by engaging
        them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire
        innovation, and that foster the development of well-rounded life skills including self-confidence,
        communication, and leadership.</p>

      <h2>FIRST Robotics Competition</h2>
      <p>
        Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. We call FIRST Robotics Competition
        the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”<br><br>
        Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team
        "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game
        against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer
        professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST
        Championship.

      <h2>CTSP Bureau & AI Robotics Hub at CTSP</h2>
      <p>
       Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) was founded in 2003, with a location chosen in the center of Taiwan(Chinese
       Taipei) because of its efficient and convenient land, sea and air transportation network. Following the
       establishment of Hsinchu Science Park and Southern Taiwan Science Park, CTSP came to include the most modern,
       concentrated and high-tech industries. CTSP has now come to include Taichung Park, Huwei Park, Houli Park, Erlin
       Park, and Chung Hsing Park which in total covers an area of 1,486 hectares. By the end of December 2018, 196
       companies, 9 incubation centers, and 6 research units were approved for residency; the planned investment is an
       estimated NT$2 trillion and NT$480 billion in capital with 143 firms in operation, creating 47,118 employment
       openings. CTSP is very aggressively leading the technology development funded industries and universities in all
       of Taiwan(Chinese Taipei). In addition to this, CTSP also plays an active role in terms of STEM and AI
       research.<br><br>
       Founded in Oct. 2017, the AI Robotics Hub at CTSP (Central Taiwan Science Park) is mainly supported by the
       Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Chinese Taipei). Its establishment is aimed at promoting and
       accelerating the development of AI and robotics related industries in Taiwan. In close collaboration with local
       enterprises, scientific research institutions, startup companies, makers, associations, colleges and
       universities, the Hub is expected to become a breeding ground for emerging AI and robotic technologies.

      <h2>ESUN Robotics Association</h2>
      <p>
        ESUN Robotics Association was one of the national and international robotics founding organizations for FLL in
        2005 and FTC in 2010 and hosted FRC Preliminary and offseason in 2018 and 2019. Afterwards it began several
        cooperative programs with many schools in the FLL and FTC programs. In this short period of time, there are now
        over 20 FIRST FRC teams reaching more than 600 students with an estimated media exposure of nearly half of all
        high schools in Taiwan(Chinese Taipei).
